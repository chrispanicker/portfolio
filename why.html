			<!-- Hello curious friend, I'm glad you decided to go down the rabbit hole and conscious mess of my code. I think that's the charm of hand made web design.-->
			<h2>So why should anyone care about "pure HTML?"</h2>
			<p>I personally think itâ€™s all about semantics. Comprehension of code has been increasingly dwindling as the major tech space has further and further removed the user experience from the technicalities that allow it to work. Although this has partially led to the development of intuitive design languages on the web, we have also seen a major drive by large tech giants to hide much of what websites may be doing. The majority of this is data collection, and obviously this may raise issues of privacy. <br><br>

			Besides problematic data collection, I think that the core of what makes this a problem in my eyes, is that we are limiting ourselves to a formulaic understanding of how UI/UX should be designed and developed. It seems as though visually and technologically, web design is greatly affected by these established conventions. So my footer is a way of highlighting the fact that a real person made every decision when it came to building this site, its functionality, and its aesthetic qualities. Not only that, but you can see my fingerprints throughout the code if you choose to right click and inspect the site. You might just find something nice. :)
